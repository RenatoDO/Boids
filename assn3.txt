I've made it so the user can change the alignment, cohesion, avoidance, and sphere radius
within UE4 ins the detail section instead of going back to the .cpp file. Having this allowed me to try different 
force values until the boids behave the way that I wanted to. 
For alignment, I've found that 30 was a decent amount.
For cohesion, I've found that 5 is the perfect amount since more makes the balls hover above each other,
and with less, they get lost as the player moves around.
For avoidance, I've set it to 25 since more makes them be to spread out and easily get lost, and with too little
they are cramped together making cohesion shoot the balls and behave wierdly.
For sphere radius, I've set it to 750 so the balls are always with the reach of the player-controlled one.
